• A Novel Hybrid Artificial Neural Network for the detection of
COVID’19 using chest X-ray images, using capsule networks along with
CNNs and HAMPS.
• The model had an accuracy of 98.04%. We also did a comparative
study with SVM and Random Forest classifier to obtain best results
with less computational resources.
